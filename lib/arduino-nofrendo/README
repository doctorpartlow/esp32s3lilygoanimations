Nofrendo 2.0pre1 - May 5, 2001

Nofrendo (c) Matt Conte
Nofrendo SDL release by Neil Stevens

To compile and install, do configure, then make, then make install
as you would any other GNU automake-using source release.  You may
want to try passing --enable-optimize to configure.

SDL 1.2 is required because recent SDL releases can speed nofrendo
a lot on X displays with more colors.

The key to an enjoyable Nofrendo experience is $HOME/.nofrendo.  In
there are all the saves, snapshots (still PCX, but that'll be fixed),
and the config.

config is auto-generated, so don't edit it while nofrendo is running.
Do feel free to edit it while nofrendo is not running, however.  Comments
are not preserved, but the data is preserved.  The enum in src/event.h is
of interest to those who want to configure their joysticks and keyboard 
input.

Nope, it's not easy to configure yet, but that will come in time.  This
release is long overdue, so a nice UI will have to wait for a later
release.

In the meantime, here are the default controls, and some hints for
joystick configuration.  Forgive if they are unclear, for this is hastily
done, and will be improved later.

Here's an excerpt from Neil's config, for use with an SNES pad:

[sdljoystick0]
button0=45
button1=46
button2=0
button3=0
button4=0
button5=0
button6=48
button7=47
negativeaxis0=51
negativeaxis1=49
positiveaxis0=52
positiveaxis1=50

Your joystick probably varies, so here are the numbers to use, if you're not
comfortable with reading the C code to find them out:

45 - Joypad 1 a
46 - Joypad 1 b
47 - Joypad 1 start
48 - Joypad 1 select
49 - Joypad 1 right
50 - Joypad 1 down
51 - Joypad 1 left
52 - Joypad 1 right
